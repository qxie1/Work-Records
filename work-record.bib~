abstract  ="When particles are suspended at air-water interfaces in the presence of a vertical magnetic field{,}
 dipole-dipole repulsion competes with capillary attraction such that 2d ordered structures self-assemble. 
By adding a horizontal and oscillating magnetic field{,} periodic deformations of the assembly are induced.
 We show herein that pulsating particle arrangements start to swim at low Reynolds number. 
We identify the physical mechanisms and geometrical ingredients behind this cooperative locomotion. 
These physical mechanisms can be exploited to much smaller scales{,} offering the possibility 
to create artificial and versatile microscopic swimmers."}

  abstract={We investigate the way in which oscillating dumb-bells, a simple microscopic model of apolar swimmers,
 move at low Reynold's number. In accordance with Purcell's Scallop Theorem a single dumb-bell cannot swim because 
its stroke is reciprocal in time. However the motion of two or more dumb-bells, with mutual phase differences, 
is not time reversal invariant, and hence swimming is possible. We use analytical and numerical solutions of the 
Stokes equations to calculate the hydrodynamic interaction between two dumb-bell swimmers and to discuss their relative motion. 
The cooperative effect of interactions between swimmers is explored by considering first regular, and then random arrays of dumb-bells.
 We find that a square array acts as a micropump. The long-time behaviour of suspensions of dumb-bells is investigated 
and compared to that of model polar swimmers.}

abstract = "We simulate the self-propulsion of devices in a fluid in the regime of low Reynolds numbers. Each device consists of three bodies (spheres or capsules) connected with two damped harmonic springs. Sinusoidal driving forces compress the springs which are resolved within a rigid body physics engine. The latter is consistently coupled to a 3D lattice Boltzmann framework for the fluid dynamics. In simulations of three-sphere devices, we find that the propulsion velocity agrees well with theoretical predictions. In simulations where some or all spheres are replaced by capsules, we find that the asymmetry of the design strongly affects the propelling efficiency. "
